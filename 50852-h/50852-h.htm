<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">I.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="ind35">Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Silver bells!</span><br />
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!<br />
<span class="ind35">How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">In the icy air of night!</span><br />
<span class="ind35">While the stars, that oversprinkle</span><br />
<span class="ind35">All the heavens, seem to twinkle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">With&nbsp; a crystalline delight;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Keeping time, time, time,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">In a sort if Runic rhyme,</span><br />
To the tintinabulation that so musically wells<br />
<span class="ind2">From the bells, bells, bells, bells,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Bells, bells, bells,&mdash;</span><br />
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">II.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="ind35">Hear the mellow wedding bells,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Golden bells!</span><br />
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!<br />
<span class="ind35">Through the balmy air of night</span><br />
<span class="ind35">How they ring out their delight!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">From the molten golden-notes,</span><br />
<span class="ind65">And all in tune,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">What a liquid ditty floats</span><br />
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">On the moon!</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Oh, from out the sounding cells,</span><br />
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">How it swells!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">How it dwells</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">On the Future! how it tells</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Of the rapture that impels</span><br />
<span class="ind25">To the swinging and the ringing</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Of the bells, bells, bells,</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,</span><br />
<span class="ind65">Bells, bells, bells&mdash;</span><br />
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!<br />

<br />
<span class="ind35">Hear the loud alarum bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Brazen bells!</span><br />
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!<br />
<span class="ind2">In the startled ear of night</span><br />
<span class="ind2">How they scream out their affright!</span><br />
<span class="ind3">Too much horrified to speak</span><br />
<span class="ind3">They can only shriek, shriek,</span><br />
<span class="ind65">Out of tune,</span><br />
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,<br />
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,<br />
<span class="ind5">Leaping higher, higher, higher,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">With a desperate desire,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">And a resolute endeavour.</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Now&mdash;now to sit or never,</span><br />
<span class="ind25">By the side of the pale-faced moon.</span><br />
<span class="ind5">Oh, the bells, bells, bells!</span><br />
<span class="ind5">What a tale their terror tells</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Of Despair!</span><br />
<span class="ind25">How they clang, and clash, and roar!</span><br />
<span class="ind25">What a horror they outpour</span><br />
<span class="ind25">On the bosom of the palpitating air!</span><br />
<span class="ind6">Yet the ear it fully knows,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">By the twanging,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">And the clanging,</span><br />
<span class="ind6">How the danger ebbs and flows:</span><br />
<span class="ind5">Yet the ear distinctly tells,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">In the jangling,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">And the wrangling,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">How the danger sinks and swells,</span><br />
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Of the bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind5">Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Bells, bells, bells&mdash;</span><br />
In the clamour and the clangour of the bells!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">IV.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="ind35">Hear the tolling of the bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Iron bells!</span><br />
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!<br />
<span class="ind35">In the silence of the night,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">How we shiver with affright</span><br />
<span class="ind25">At the melancholy menace of their tone!</span><br />
<span class="ind35">For every sound that floats</span><br />
<span class="ind35">From the rust within their throats</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Is a groan.</span><br />
<span class="ind35">And the people&mdash;ah, the people&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">They that dwell up in the steeple,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">All alone,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">In that muffled monotone,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Feel a glory in so rolling</span><br />
<span class="ind5">On the human heart a stone&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">They are neither man nor woman&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">They are neither brute nor human&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">They are Ghouls:</span><br />
<span class="ind5">And their king it is who tolls;</span><br />
<span class="ind5">And he rolls, rolls, rolls,</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Rolls</span><br />
<span class="ind6">A paean from the bells!</span><br />
<span class="ind35">And his merry bosom swells</span><br />
<span class="ind5">With the paean of the bells!</span><br />
<span class="ind35">And he dances, and he yells;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Keeping time, time, time,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">In a sort of Runic rhyme,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">To the paean of the bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind7">Of the bells:</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Keeping time, time, time,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">In a sort of Runic rhyme,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">To the throbbing of the bells</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Of the bells, bells, bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind5">To the sobbing of the bells;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Keeping time, time, time,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">As he knells, knells, knells,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">In a happy Runic rhyme,</span><br />
<span class="ind5">To the rolling of the bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Of the bells, bells, bells:</span><br />
<span class="ind5">To the tolling of the bells,</span><br />
<span class="ind35">Of the bells, bells, bells, bells&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind5">Bells, bells, bells&mdash;</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span class="ind65">I dwelt alone</span><br />
<span class="ind65">In a world of moan,</span><br />
<span class="ind15">And my soul was a stagnant tide,</span><br />
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride&mdash;<br />
Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.<br />
<br />
<span class="ind65">Ah, less&mdash;less bright</span><br />
<span class="ind65">The stars of the night</span><br />
<span class="ind15">Than the eyes of the radiant girl!</span><br />
<span class="ind65">And never a flake</span><br />
<span class="ind65">That the vapour can make</span><br />
<span class="ind15">With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,</span><br />
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl&mdash;<br />
Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless curl.<br />
<br />
<span class="ind65">Now doubt&mdash;now Pain</span><br />
<span class="ind65">Come never again,</span><br />
<span class="ind15">For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,</span><br />
<span class="ind65">And all day long</span><br />
<span class="ind65">Shines, bright and strong,</span><br />
<span class="ind15">Astarté within the sky,</span><br />
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye&mdash;<br />
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.<br />

<h2><i><a id="ANNABEL_LEE"></a>ANNABEL LEE</i></h2>


<p class="poem">
It was many and many a year ago,<br />
<span class="ind25">In a kingdom by the sea,</span><br />
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br />
<span class="ind25">By the name of <span class="smcap">Annabel Lee</span>;</span><br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />
<span class="ind25">Than to love and be loved by me.</span><br />
<br />
I was a child and <i>she</i> was a child,<br />
<span class="ind25">In this kingdom by the sea;</span><br />
But we loved with a love which was more than love&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind25">I and my Annabel Lee;</span><br />
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven<br />
<span class="ind25">Coveted her and me.</span><br />
<br />
And this was the reason that, long ago,<br />
<span class="ind25">In this kingdom by the sea,</span><br />
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br />
My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br />
<span class="ind25">And bore her away from me,</span><br />
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br />
<span class="ind25">In this kingdom by the sea.</span><br />
<br />
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,<br />
<span class="ind25">Went envying her and me&mdash;</span><br />
Yes!&mdash;that was the reason (as all men know,<br />
<span class="ind25">In this kingdom by the sea)</span><br />
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br />
<span class="ind25">Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</span><br />
<br />
But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br />
<span class="ind25">Of those who were older than we&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Of many far wiser than we&mdash;</span><br />
And neither the angels in heaven above,<br />
<span class="ind25">Nor the demons down under the sea,</span><br />
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br />
<span class="ind25">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />
<br />
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br />
<span class="ind25">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</span><br />
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes<br />
<span class="ind25">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</span><br />
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br />
Of my darling&mdash;my darling&mdash;my life and my bride,<br />
<span class="ind25">In her sepulchre there by the sea,</span><br />
<span class="ind25">In her tomb by the sounding sea.</span><br />

<h2><i>THE RAVEN</i></h2>


<p class="poem">
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br />
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">Only this, and nothing more."</span><br />
<br />
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br />
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br />
Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow<br />
From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br />
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">Nameless here for evermore.</span><br />
<br />
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />
Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br />
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br />
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">This it is, and nothing more."</span><br />
<br />
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br />
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br />
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br />
That I scarce was sure I heard you,"&mdash;here I opened wide the door;&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">Darkness there, and nothing more.</span><br />
<br />
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br />
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br />
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br />
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br />
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">Merely this, and nothing more.</span><br />
<br />
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br />
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br />
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:<br />
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br />
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">'Tis the wind and nothing more."</span><br />
<br />
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br />
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br />
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br />
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br />
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind6">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span><br />
<br />
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br />
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br />
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore&mdash;<br />
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br />
<span class="ind6">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br />
Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br />
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br />
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br />
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br />
<span class="ind6">With such name as "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br />
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br />
Nothing further then he uttered&mdash;not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br />
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before&mdash;<br />
On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br />
<span class="ind6">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br />
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br />
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br />
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore&mdash;<br />
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br />
<span class="ind6">Of 'Never&mdash;nevermore'."</span><br />
<br />
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br />
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br />
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br />
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br />
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br />
<span class="ind6">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br />
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br />
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br />
<span class="ind6"><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span><br />
<br />
Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br />
Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br />
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee<br />
Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!<br />
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"<br />
<span class="ind6">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!&mdash;<br />
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br />
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&mdash;<br />
On this home by horror haunted&mdash;tell me truly, I implore&mdash;<br />
Is there&mdash;<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore!"<br />
<span class="ind6">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!<br />
By that Heaven that bends above us&mdash;by that God we both adore&mdash;<br />
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br />
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br />
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br />
<span class="ind6">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting&mdash;<br />
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br />
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br />
Leave my loneliness unbroken!&mdash;quit the bust above my door!<br />
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br />
<span class="ind6">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br />
<br />
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br />
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br />
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br />
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br />
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />
<span class="ind6">Shall be lifted&mdash;nevermore!</span><br />

Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!<br />
My spirit not awakening, till the beam<br />

Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,<br />
'Twere better than the cold reality<br />
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,<br />
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,<br />
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.<br />
But should it be&mdash;that dream eternally<br />
Continuing&mdash;as dreams have been to me<br />
In my young boyhood&mdash;should it thus be given,<br />
'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.<br />
For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright<br />
I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light<br />
And loveliness,&mdash;have left my very heart<br />
In climes of my imagining, apart<br />
From mine own home, with beings that have been<br />
Of mine own thought&mdash;what more could I have seen?<br />
'Twas once&mdash;and only once&mdash;and the wild hour<br />
From my remembrance shall not pass&mdash;some power<br />
Or spell had bound me&mdash;'twas the chilly wind<br />
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind<br />
Its image on my spirit&mdash;or the moon<br />
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon<br />
Too coldly&mdash;or the stars&mdash;howe'er it was<br />
That dream was as that night-wind&mdash;let it pass.<br />
I <i>have been</i> happy, tho' in a dream.<br />
I have been happy&mdash;and I love the theme:<br />
Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life,<br />
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife<br />
Of semblance with reality, which brings<br />
To the delirious eye, more lovely things<br />
Of Paradise and Love&mdash;and all our own!<br />
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.<br />

<p class="poem">
I saw thee once&mdash;once only&mdash;years ago:<br />
I must not say <i>how</i> many&mdash;but <i>not</i> many.<br />
It was a July midnight; and from out<br />
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,<br />
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,<br />
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,<br />
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,<br />
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand<br />
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,<br />
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe&mdash;<br />
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses<br />
That gave out, in return for the love-light,<br />
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death&mdash;<br />
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses<br />
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted<br />
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.<br />
<br />
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank<br />
I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon<br />
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,<br />
And on thine own, upturn'd&mdash;alas, in sorrow!<br />
<br />
Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight&mdash;<br />
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)<br />
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,<br />
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?<br />
No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,<br />
Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!&mdash;oh, God<br />
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)<br />
Save only thee and me. I paused&mdash;I looked&mdash;<br />
And in an instant all things disappeared.<br />
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)<br />
<br />
The pearly lustre of the moon went out:<br />
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,<br />
The happy flowers and the repining trees,<br />
Were seen no more: the very roses' odours<br />
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.<br />
All&mdash;all expired save thee&mdash;save less than thou:<br />
Save only the divine light in thine eyes&mdash;<br />
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.<br />
I saw but them&mdash;they were the world to me!<br />
I saw but them&mdash;saw only them for hours,<br />
Saw only them until the moon went down.<br />
What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten<br />
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!<br />

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne<br />
In a strange city lying alone<br />
Far down within the dim West,<br />
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best<br />

There shrines and palaces and towers<br />
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)<br />

Around, by lifting winds forgot,<br />
Resignedly beneath the sky<br />
The melancholy waters lie.<br />

Upon the quiet mountain top,<br />
Steals drowsily and musically<br />
Into the universal valley.<br />
The rosemary nods upon the grave;<br />
The lily lolls upon the wave;<br />
Wrapping the fog about its breast,<br />
The ruin moulders into rest;<br />
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake<br />

Our talk had been serious and sober,<br />
<span class="ind25">But our thoughts they were palsied and sere&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Our memories were treacherous and sere&mdash;</span><br />
For we knew not the month was October,<br />
<span class="ind25">And we marked not the night of the year&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)</span><br />
We noted not the dim lake of Auber&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind25">(Though once we had journeyed down here),</span><br />
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,<br />
<span class="ind25">Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</span><br />
And now, as the night was senescent,<br />
<span class="ind25">And star-dials pointed to morn&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">As the star-dials hinted of morn&mdash;</span><br />
At the end of our path a liquescent<br />
<span class="ind25">And nebulous lustre was born,</span><br />
Out of which a miraculous crescent<br />
<span class="ind25">Arose with a duplicate horn&mdash;</span><br />
Astarte's bediamonded crescent<br />
<span class="ind25">Distinct with its duplicate horn.</span><br />
<br />
And I said&mdash;"She is warmer than Dian:<br />
<span class="ind25">She rolls through an ether of sighs&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">She revels in a region of sighs:</span><br />
She has seen that the tears are not dry on<br />
<span class="ind25">These cheeks, where the worm never dies,</span><br />
And has come past the stars of the Lion,<br />
<span class="ind25">To point us the path to the skies&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">To the Lethean peace of the skies&mdash;</span><br />
Come up, in despite of the Lion,<br />
<span class="ind25">To shine on us with her bright eyes&mdash;</span><br />
Come up through the lair of the Lion,<br />
<span class="ind25">With love in her luminous eyes."</span><br />
<br />
But Psyche, uplifting her finger,<br />
<span class="ind25">Said&mdash;"Sadly this star I mistrust&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Her pallor I strangely mistrust:&mdash;</span><br />
Oh, hasten!&mdash;oh, let us not linger!<br />
<span class="ind25">Oh, fly!&mdash;let us fly!&mdash;for we must."</span><br />
In terror she spoke, letting sink her<br />
<span class="ind25">Wings until they trailed in the dust&mdash;</span><br />
In agony sobbed, letting sink her<br />
<span class="ind25">Plumes till they trailed in the dust&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</span><br />
<br />
I replied&mdash;"This is nothing but dreaming:<br />
<span class="ind25">Let us on by this tremulous light!</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Let us bathe in this crystalline light!</span><br />
Its Sybilic splendour is beaming<br />
<span class="ind25">With Hope and in Beauty to-night:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">See!&mdash;it flickers up the sky through the night!</span><br />
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,<br />
<span class="ind25">And be sure it will lead us aright&mdash;</span><br />
We safely may trust to a gleaming<br />
<span class="ind25">That cannot but guide us aright,</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,<br />
<span class="ind25">And tempted her out of her gloom&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">And conquered her scruples and gloom;</span><br />
And we passed to the end of the vista,<br />
<span class="ind25">But were stopped by the door of a tomb&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">By the door of a legended tomb;</span><br />
And I said&mdash;"What is written, sweet sister,<br />
<span class="ind25">On the door of this legended tomb?"</span><br />
<span class="ind25">She replied&mdash;"Ulalume&mdash;Ulalume&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober<br />
<span class="ind25">As the leaves that were crisped and sere&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">As the leaves that were withering and sere;</span><br />
And I cried&mdash;"It was surely October<br />
<span class="ind25">On <i>this</i> very night of last year</span><br />
<span class="ind25">That I journeyed&mdash;I journeyed down here&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">That I brought a dread burden down here&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind25">On this night of all nights in the year,</span><br />
<span class="ind25">Ah, what demon has tempted me here?</span><br />
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind25">This misty mid region of Weir&mdash;</span><br />
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,<br />

Oh, nothing of the dross of ours&mdash;<br />
Yet all the beauty&mdash;all the flowers<br />
That list our Love, and deck our bowers&mdash;<br />
Adorn yon world afar, afar&mdash;<br />
The wandering star.<br />
<br />
<span class="ind1">'Twas a sweet time for Nesace&mdash;for there</span><br />
Her world lay lolling on the golden air,<br />
Near four bright suns&mdash;a temporary rest&mdash;<br />
An oasis in desert of the blest.<br />
Away&mdash;away&mdash;'mid seas of rays that roll<br />
Empyrean splendour o'er th' unchained soul&mdash;<br />
The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)<br />
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,&mdash;<br />
To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode<br />
And late to ours, the favour'd one of God&mdash;<br />
But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,<br />
She throws aside the sceptre&mdash;leaves the helm,<br />
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,<br />
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.<br />
<br />
Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,<br />
Whence sprang the "Idea of Beauty" into birth,<br />
(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,<br />
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,<br />
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)<br />
She looked into Infinity&mdash;and knelt.<br />
Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled&mdash;<br />
Fit emblems of the model of her world&mdash;<br />
Seen but in beauty&mdash;not impeding sight<br />
Of other beauty glittering thro' the light&mdash;<br />
A wreath that twined each starry form around,<br />
And all the opal'd air in colour bound.<br />
<br />
<span class="ind1">All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed</span><br />
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head<br />
On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang<br />
So eagerly around about to hang<br />
Upon the flying footsteps of&mdash;&mdash;deep pride&mdash;<br />
Of her who lov'd a mortal&mdash;and so died.<br />
The Sephalica, budding with young bees,<br />
Upreared its purple stem around her knees:&mdash;<br />
And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd&mdash;<br />
Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd<br />
All other loveliness:&mdash;its honied dew<br />
(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)<br />
Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven.<br />
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven<br />
In Trebizond&mdash;and on a sunny flower<br />
So like its own above that, to this hour,<br />
It still remaineth, torturing the bee<br />
With madness, and unwonted reverie:<br />
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf<br />
And blossom of the fairy plant in grief<br />
Disconsolate linger&mdash;grief that hangs her head,<br />
Repenting follies that full long have fled,<br />
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,<br />
Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair:<br />
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light<br />
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:<br />
And Clytia, pondering between many a sun,<br />
While pettish tears adown her petals run:<br />
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth,<br />
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,<br />
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing<br />
Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:<br />
And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown<br />
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:<br />
And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!<br />
Isola d'oro!&mdash;Fior di Levante!<br />
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever<br />
With Indian Cupid down the holy river&mdash;<br />
Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given<br />
To bear the Goddess' song, in odours, up to Heaven<br />
<br />
<span class="ind2">"Spirit! thou dwellest where,</span><br />
<span class="ind3">In the deep sky,</span><br />
<span class="ind2">The terrible and fair,</span><br />

<br />
She ceas'd&mdash;and buried then her burning cheek<br />
Abash'd, amid the lilies there, too seek<br />
A shelter from the fervour of His eye;<br />
For the stars trembled at the Deity.<br />
She stirr'd not&mdash;breath'd not&mdash;for a voice was there<br />
How solemnly pervading the calm air!<br />
A sound of silence on the startled ear<br />
Which dreamy poets name "the music of the sphere."<br />
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call<br />
"Silence"&mdash;which is the merest word of all.<br />
All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things<br />
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings&mdash;<br />
But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high<br />
The eternal voice of God is passing by,<br />
And the red winds are withering in the sky:&mdash;<br />

Linked to a little system, and one sun&mdash;<br />

The single-moonèd eve!&mdash;on Earth we plight<br />
Our faith to one love&mdash;and one moon adore&mdash;<br />
The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.<br />
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours<br />
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,<br />
And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain<br />
Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="ind105">PART II.</span><br />
<br />
High on a mountain of enamell'd head&mdash;<br />
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed<br />
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,<br />
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees<br />
With many a mutter'd "hope to be forgiven"<br />
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven&mdash;<br />
Of Rosy head that, towering far away<br />
Into the sunlight ether, caught the ray<br />
Of sunken suns at eve&mdash;at noon of night,<br />
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light<br />
Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile<br />
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,<br />
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile<br />
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,<br />
And nursled the young mountain in its lair.<br />
Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall<br />
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall<br />
Of their own dissolution, while they die&mdash;<br />
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.<br />
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,<br />
Sat gently on these columns as a crown&mdash;<br />
A window of one circular diamond, there,<br />
Look'd out above into the purple air,<br />
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain<br />
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,<br />
Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,<br />
Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.<br />
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen<br />
The dimness of this world: that greyish green<br />
That Nature love's the best for Beauty's grave<br />
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave&mdash;<br />
And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout<br />
That from his marble dwelling peerèd out,<br />
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche&mdash;<br />
Achaian statues in a world so rich?<br />
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis&mdash;<br />
From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss<br />
Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave<br />
Is now upon thee&mdash;but too late to save!<br />
<br />
<span class="ind1">Sound loves to revel in a summer night:</span><br />
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight<br />
That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,<br />
Of many a wild star-gazer long ago&mdash;<br />
That stealeth ever on the ear of him<br />
Who, musing, gazeth on the distant dim,<br />
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud&mdash;<br />
Is not its form&mdash;its voice&mdash;most palpable and loud?<br />
<br />
<span class="ind1">But what is this?&mdash;it cometh, and it brings</span><br />
A music with it&mdash;'tis the rush of wings&mdash;<br />
A pause&mdash;and then a sweeping, falling strain<br />
And Nesace is in her halls again.<br />
From the wild energy of wanton haste<br />
<span class="ind1">Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;</span><br />
And zone that clung around her gentle waist<br />
<span class="ind1">Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.</span><br />
Within the centre of that hall to breathe,<br />
She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,<br />
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair<br />
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="ind1">Young flowers were whispering in melody</span><br />
To happy flowers that night&mdash;and tree to tree;<br />
Fountains were gushing music as they fell<br />
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;<br />
Yet silence came upon material things&mdash;<br />
Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings&mdash;<br />
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang<br />
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:<br />
<br />
<span class="ind2">"'Neath the blue-bell or streamer&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind3">Or tufted wild spray</span><br />
<span class="ind2">That keeps, from the dreamer,</span><br />

<span class="ind2">On the stars which your wonder</span><br />

Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,<br />
A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro'<br />
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight&mdash;<br />
Seraphs in all but "Knowledge," the keen light<br />
That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar,<br />
O Death! from eye of God upon that star:<br />
Sweet was that error&mdash;sweeter still that death&mdash;<br />
Sweet was that error&mdash;even with <i>us</i> the breath<br />
Of Science dims the mirror of our joy&mdash;<br />
To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy&mdash;<br />
For what (to them) availeth it to know<br />
That Truth is Falsehood&mdash;or that Bliss is Woe?<br />
Sweet was their death&mdash;with them to die was rife<br />
With the last ecstasy of satiate life&mdash;<br />
Beyond that death no immortality&mdash;<br />
But sleep that pondereth and is not "to be"&mdash;<br />
And there!&mdash;oh! may my weary spirit dwell&mdash;<br />
Apart from Heaven's Eternity&mdash;and yet how far from Hell!<br />
What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,<br />
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?<br />
But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts<br />
To those who hear not for their beating hearts.<br />
A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover&mdash;<br />
O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)<br />
Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?<br />
Unguided Love hath fallen&mdash;'mid "tears of perfect moan."<br />
<br />
He was a goodly spirit&mdash;he who fell:<br />
A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well&mdash;<br />
A gazer on the lights that shine above&mdash;<br />
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:<br />
What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,<br />
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair&mdash;<br />
And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy<br />
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.<br />
The night had found (to him a night of woe)<br />
Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo&mdash;<br />
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,<br />
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it<br />
Here sat he with his love&mdash;his dark eye bent<br />
With eagle gaze along the firmament:<br />
Now turn'd it upon her&mdash;but ever then<br />
It trembled to the orb of <span class="smcap">Earth</span> again.<br />
<br />
"Ianthe, dearest, see&mdash;how dim that ray!<br />
How lovely 'tis to look so far away!<br />
She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve<br />
I left her gorgeous halls&mdash;nor mourn'd to leave.<br />
That eve&mdash;that eve&mdash;I should remember well&mdash;<br />
The sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell<br />
On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall<br />
Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall&mdash;<br />
And on my eyelids&mdash;O the heavy light!<br />
How drowsily it weigh'd them into night!<br />
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran<br />
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:<br />
But O that light!&mdash;I slumber'd&mdash;Death, the while,<br />
Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle<br />
So softly that no single silken hair<br />
Awoke that slept&mdash;or knew that he was there.<br />
<br />
"The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon<br />
Was a proud temple called the Parthenon;<br />
More beauty clung around her column'd wall<br />
Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal,<br />
And when old Time my wing did disenthral<br />
Thence sprang I&mdash;as the eagle from his tower,<br />
And years I left behind me in an hour.<br />
What time upon her airy bounds I hung,<br />
One half the garden of her globe was flung<br />
Unrolling as a chart unto my view&mdash;<br />
Tenantless cities of the desert too!<br />
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,<br />
And half I wish'd to be again of men."<br />
<br />
"My Angelo! and why of them to be?<br />
A brighter dwelling place is here for thee&mdash;<br />
And greener fields than in yon world above,<br />
And woman's loveliness&mdash;and passionate love."<br />
<br />
"But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft<br />
Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft,<br />
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy&mdash;but the world<br />
I left so late was into chaos hurl'd&mdash;<br />
Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,<br />
And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.<br />
Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar<br />
And fell&mdash;not swiftly as I rose before,<br />
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'<br />
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!<br />
Nor long the measure of my falling hours,<br />
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours&mdash;<br />
Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,<br />
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth."<br />
<br />
"We came&mdash;and to thy Earth&mdash;but not to us<br />
Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:<br />
We came, my love; around, above, below,<br />
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,<br />
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod<br />
<i>She</i> grants to us, as granted by her God&mdash;<br />
But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd<br />
Never his fairy wing o'er fairier world!<br />
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes<br />
Alone could see the phantom in the skies,<br />
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be<br />
Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea&mdash;<br />
But when its glory swell'd upon the sky,<br />
As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,<br />
We paused before the heritage of men,<br />
And thy star trembled&mdash;as doth Beauty then!"<br />
<br />
Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away<br />
The night that waned and waned and brought no day.<br />
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts<br />
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.<br />

<h2><i>THE VALLEY OF UNREST</i></h2>


<p class="poem">
<i>Once</i> it smiled a silent dell<br />
Where the people did not dwell;<br />
They had gone unto the wars,<br />
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,<br />
Nightly, from their azure towers,<br />
To keep watch above the flowers,<br />
In the midst of which all day<br />
The red sunlight lazily lay.<br />
<i>Now</i> each visitor shall confess<br />
The sad valley's restlessness.<br />
Nothing there is motionless&mdash;<br />
Nothing save the airs that brood<br />
Over the magic solitude.<br />
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees<br />
That palpitate like the chill seas<br />
Around the misty Hebrides!<br />
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven<br />
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven<br />
Uneasily, from morn till even,<br />
Over the violets there that lie<br />
In myriad types of the human eye&mdash;<br />
Over the lilies there that wave<br />
And weep above a nameless grave!<br />
They wave:&mdash;from out their fragrant tops<br />
Eternal dews come down in drops.<br />
They weep:&mdash;from off their delicate stems<br />
Perennial tears descend in gems.<br />

In spring of youth it was my lot<br />
To haunt of the wide world a spot<br />
The which I could not love the less&mdash;<br />
So lovely was the loneliness<br />
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,<br />
And the tall pines that towered around.<br />
<br />
But when the Night had thrown her pall<br />
Upon that spot, as upon all,<br />
And the mystic wind went by<br />
Murmuring in melody&mdash;<br />
Then&mdash;ah then I would awake<br />
To the terror of the lone lake<br />
Yet that terror was not fright,<br />
But a tremulous delight&mdash;<br />
A feeling not the jewelled mine<br />
Could teach or bribe me to define&mdash;<br />
Nor Love&mdash;although the Love were thine.<br />
<br />
Death was in that poisonous wave,<br />
And in its gulf a fitting grave<br />
For him who thence could solace bring<br />
To his lone imagining&mdash;<br />
Whose solitary sole could make<br />
An Eden of that dim lake.<br />

Not long ago, the writer of these lines,<br />
In the mad pride of intellectuality,<br />
Maintained "the power of words"&mdash;denied that ever<br />
A thought arose within the human brain<br />
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:<br />
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,<br />
Two words&mdash;two foreign soft dissyllables&mdash;<br />
Italian tones, made only to be murmured<br />
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew<br />
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"<br />
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,<br />
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,<br />
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions<br />
Than even seraph harper, Israfel,<br />
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")<br />
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.<br />
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.<br />
With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,<br />
I cannot write&mdash;I cannot speak or think&mdash;<br />
Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,<br />
This standing motionless upon the golden<br />
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams.<br />
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,<br />
And thrilling as I see, upon the right,<br />
Upon the left, and all the way along,<br />
Amid empurpled vapours, far away<br />

In youth have I known one with whom the Earth<br />

<p class="poem">
Thank Heaven! the crisis&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">The danger is past,</span><br />
And the lingering illness<br />
<span class="ind1">Is over at last&mdash;</span><br />
And the fever called "Living"<br />
<span class="ind1">Is conquered at last.</span><br />
<br />
Sadly, I know<br />
<span class="ind1">I am shorn of my strength,</span><br />
And no muscle I move<br />
<span class="ind1">As I lie at full length&mdash;</span><br />
But no matter!&mdash;I feel<br />
<span class="ind1">I am better at length.</span><br />
<br />
And I rest so composedly,<br />
<span class="ind1">Now, in my bed,</span><br />
That any beholder<br />
<span class="ind1">Might fancy me dead&mdash;</span><br />
Might start at beholding me,<br />
<span class="ind1">Thinking me dead.</span><br />
<br />
The moaning and groaning,<br />
<span class="ind1">The sighing and sobbing,</span><br />
Are quieted now,<br />
<span class="ind1">With that horrible throbbing</span><br />
At heart:&mdash;ah, that horrible,<br />
<span class="ind1">Horrible throbbing!</span><br />
<br />
The sickness&mdash;the nausea&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">The pitiless pain&mdash;</span><br />
Have ceased, with the fever<br />
<span class="ind1">That maddened my brain&mdash;</span><br />
With the fever called "Living"<br />
<span class="ind1">That burned in my brain.</span><br />
<br />
And oh! of all torture<br />
<span class="ind1"><i>That</i> torture the worst</span><br />
Has abated&mdash;the terrible<br />
<span class="ind1">Torture of thirst</span><br />
For the naphthaline river<br />
<span class="ind1">Of Passion accurst:&mdash;</span><br />
I have drunk of a water<br />
<span class="ind1">That quenches all thirst:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Of a water that flows,<br />
<span class="ind1">With a lullaby sound,</span><br />
From a spring but a very few<br />
<span class="ind1">Feet under ground&mdash;</span><br />
From a cavern not very far<br />
<span class="ind1">Down under ground.</span><br />
<br />
And ah! let it never<br />
<span class="ind1">Be foolishly said</span><br />
That my room it is gloomy<br />
<span class="ind1">And narrow my bed;</span><br />
For man never slept<br />
<span class="ind1">In a different bed&mdash;</span><br />
And, <i>to sleep</i>, you must slumber<br />
<span class="ind1">In just such a bed.</span><br />
<br />
My tantalized spirit<br />
<span class="ind1">Here blandly reposes.</span><br />
Forgetting, or never<br />
<span class="ind1">Regretting its roses&mdash;</span><br />
Its old agitations<br />
<span class="ind1">Of myrtles and roses;</span><br />
<br />
For now, while so quietly<br />
<span class="ind1">Lying, it fancies</span><br />
A holier odour<br />
<span class="ind1">About it, of pansies&mdash;</span><br />
A rosemary odour,<br />
<span class="ind1">Commingled with pansies&mdash;</span><br />
With rue and the beautiful<br />
<span class="ind1">Puritan pansies.</span><br />
<br />
And so it lies happily,<br />
<span class="ind1">Bathing in many</span><br />
A dream of the truth<br />
<span class="ind1">And the beauty of Annie&mdash;</span><br />
Drowned in a bath<br />
<span class="ind1">Of the tresses of Annie.</span><br />
<br />
She tenderly kissed me,<br />
<span class="ind1">She fondly caressed,</span><br />
And then I fell gently<br />
<span class="ind1">To sleep on her breast</span><br />
Deeply to sleep<br />
<span class="ind1">From the heaven of her breast.</span><br />
<br />
When the light was extinguished<br />
<span class="ind1">She covered me warm,</span><br />
And she prayed to the angels<br />
<span class="ind1">To keep me from harm&mdash;</span><br />
To the queen of the angels<br />
<span class="ind1">To shield me from harm.</span><br />
<br />
And I lie so composedly,<br />
<span class="ind1">Now, in my bed,</span><br />
(Knowing her love)<br />
<span class="ind1">That you fancy me dead&mdash;</span><br />
And I rest so contentedly,<br />
<span class="ind1">Now, in my bed,</span><br />
(With her love at my breast)<br />
<span class="ind1">That you fancy me dead&mdash;</span><br />
That you shudder to look at me,<br />
<span class="ind1">Thinking me dead;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
But my heart it is brighter<br />
<span class="ind1">Than all of the many</span><br />
Stars in the sky,<br />
<span class="ind1">For it sparkles with Annie&mdash;</span><br />
It glows with the light<br />
<span class="ind1">Of the love of my Annie&mdash;</span><br />
With the thought of the light<br />
<span class="ind1">Of the eyes of my Annie.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
From childhood's hour I have not been<br />
As others were; I have not seen<br />
As others saw; I could not bring<br />
My passions from a common spring.<br />
From the same source I have not taken<br />
My sorrow; I could not awaken<br />
My heart to joy at the same tone;<br />
And all I loved <i>I</i> loved alone.<br />
Then&mdash;in my childhood, in the dawn<br />
Of a most stormy life&mdash;was drawn<br />
From every depth of good and ill<br />
The mystery which binds me still:<br />
From the torrent, or the fountain,<br />
From the red cliff of the mountain,<br />
From the sun that round me rolled<br />
In its autumn tint of gold,<br />
From the lightning in the sky<br />
As it passed me flying by,<br />
From the thunder and the storm,<br />
And the cloud that took the form<br />
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br />
Of a demon in my view.<br />

<p class="poem">
Kind solace in a dying hour!<br />
<span class="ind1">Such, father, is not (now) my theme&mdash;</span><br />
I will not madly deem that power<br />
<span class="ind2">Of Earth may shrive me of the sin</span><br />
<span class="ind2">Unearthly pride hath revell'd in&mdash;</span><br />
I have no time to dote or dream:<br />
You call it hope&mdash;that fire of fire!<br />
It is but agony of desire:<br />
If I <i>can</i> hope&mdash;O God! I can&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">Its fount is holier&mdash;more divine&mdash;</span><br />
I would not call thee fool, old man,<br />
<span class="ind1">But such is not a gift of thine.</span><br />
<br />
Know thou the secret of a spirit<br />
<span class="ind1">Bow'd from its wild pride into shame.</span><br />
O yearning heart! I did inherit<br />
<span class="ind1">Thy withering portion with the fame,</span><br />
The searing glory which hath shone<br />
Amid the jewels of my throne,<br />
Halo of Hell! and with a pain<br />
Not Hell shall make me fear again&mdash;<br />
O craving heart, for the lost flowers<br />
And sunshine of my summer hours!<br />
The undying voice of that dead time,<br />
With its interminable chime,<br />
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,<br />
Upon thy emptiness&mdash;a knell.<br />

<p class="poem">
I have not always been as now:<br />
The fever'd diadem on my brow<br />
<span class="ind1">I claim'd and won usurpingly&mdash;</span><br />
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given<br />
<span class="ind1">Rome to the Cæsar&mdash;this to me?</span><br />
<span class="ind2">The heritage of a kingly mind,</span><br />
And a proud spirit which hath striven<br />
<span class="ind2">Triumphantly with human kind.</span><br />
<br />
On mountain soil I first drew life:<br />
<span class="ind1">The mists of the Taglay have shed</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Nightly their dews upon my head,</span><br />
And, I believe, the wingèd strife<br />
And tumult of the headlong air<br />
Have nestled in my very hair.<br />
<br />
So late from Heaven&mdash;that dew&mdash;it fell<br />
<span class="ind1">('Mid dreams of an unholy night)</span><br />
Upon me with the touch of Hell,<br />
<span class="ind1">While the red flashing of the light</span><br />
From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,<br />
<span class="ind1">Appeared to my half-closing eye</span><br />
<span class="ind1">The pageantry of monarchy,</span><br />
And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar<br />
<span class="ind1">Came hurriedly upon me, telling</span><br />
<span class="ind2">Of human battle, where my voice,</span><br />
My own voice, silly child!&mdash;was swelling<br />
<span class="ind2">(O! how my spirit would rejoice,</span><br />
And leap within me at the cry)<br />
The battle-cry of Victory!<br />
The rain came down upon my head<br />
<span class="ind1">Unshelter'd&mdash;and the heavy wind</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.</span><br />
It was but man, I thought, who shed<br />
<span class="ind1">Laurels upon me: and the rush&mdash;</span><br />
The torrent of the chilly air<br />
<span class="ind1">Gurgled within my ear the crush</span><br />
Of empires&mdash;with the captive's prayer&mdash;<br />
The hum of suitors&mdash;and the tone<br />
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.<br />
<br />
My passions, from that hapless hour,<br />
<span class="ind1">Usurp'd a tyranny which men</span><br />
Have deem'd since I have reach'd to power,<br />
<span class="ind2">My innate nature&mdash;be it so:</span><br />
<span class="ind1">But father, there liv'd one who, then,</span><br />
Then&mdash;in my boyhood&mdash;when their fire<br />
<span class="ind1">Burn'd with a still intenser glow,</span><br />
(For passion must, with youth, expire)<br />
<span class="ind1">E'en <i>then</i> who knew this iron heart</span><br />
<span class="ind1">In woman's weakness had a part.</span><br />
<br />
I have no words&mdash;alas!&mdash;to tell<br />
The loveliness of loving well!<br />
Nor would I now attempt to trace<br />
The more than beauty of a face<br />
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,<br />
Are&mdash;&mdash;shadows on th' unstable wind<br />
Thus I remember having dwelt<br />
<span class="ind1">Some page of early lore upon,</span><br />
With loitering eye, till I have felt<br />
The letters&mdash;with their meaning&mdash;melt<br />
<span class="ind1">To fantasies&mdash;with none.</span><br />
<br />
O, she was worthy of all love!<br />
<span class="ind1">Love&mdash;as in infancy was mine&mdash;</span><br />
'Twas such as angel minds above<br />
<span class="ind1">Might envy; her young heart the shrine</span><br />
On which my every hope and thought<br />
<span class="ind1">Were incense&mdash;then a goodly gift,</span><br />
<span class="ind2">For they were childish and upright&mdash;</span><br />
Pure&mdash;as her young example taught:<br />
<span class="ind1">Why did I leave it, and, adrift,</span><br />
<span class="ind2">Trust to the fire within, for light?</span><br />
<br />
We grew in age&mdash;and love&mdash;together,<br />
<span class="ind1">Roaming the forest, and the wild;</span><br />
My breast her shield in wintry weather&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">And, when the friendly sunshine smil'd</span><br />
And she would mark the opening skies,<br />
<i>I</i> saw no Heaven&mdash;but in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Young Love's first lesson is&mdash;the heart:<br />
<span class="ind1">For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,</span><br />
When, from our little cares apart,<br />
<span class="ind1">And laughing at her girlish wiles,</span><br />
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,<br />
<span class="ind1">And pour my spirit out in tears&mdash;</span><br />
There was no need to speak the rest&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">No need to quiet any fears</span><br />
Of her&mdash;who ask'd no reason why,<br />
But turned on me her quiet eye!<br />
<br />
Yet <i>more</i> than worthy of the love<br />
My spirit struggled with, and strove,<br />
When, on the mountain peak, alone,<br />
Ambition lent it a new tone&mdash;<br />
I had no being&mdash;but in thee:<br />
<span class="ind1">The world, and all it did contain</span><br />
In the earth&mdash;the air&mdash;the sea&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">Its joy&mdash;its little lot of pain</span><br />
That was new pleasure&mdash;the ideal,<br />
<span class="ind1">Dim vanities of dreams by night&mdash;</span><br />
And dimmer nothings which were real&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">(Shadows&mdash;and a more shadowy light!)</span><br />
Parted upon their misty wings,<br />
<span class="ind1">And, so, confusedly, became</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Thine image, and&mdash;a name&mdash;a name!</span><br />
Two separate&mdash;yet most intimate things.<br />
<br />
I was ambitious&mdash;have you known<br />
<span class="ind1">The passion, father? You have not:</span><br />
A cottager, I mark'd a throne<br />
Of half the world as all my own,<br />
<span class="ind1">And murmur'd at such lowly lot&mdash;</span><br />
But, just like any other dream,<br />
<span class="ind1">Upon the vapour of the dew</span><br />
My own had past, did not the beam<br />
<span class="ind1">Of beauty which did while it thro'</span><br />
The minute&mdash;the hour&mdash;the day&mdash;oppress<br />
My mind with double loveliness.<br />
<br />
We walk'd together on the crown<br />
Of a high mountain which look'd down<br />
Afar from its proud natural towers<br />
<span class="ind1">Of rock and forest, on the hills&mdash;</span><br />
The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,<br />
<span class="ind1">And shouting with a thousand rills.</span><br />
<br />
I spoke to her of power and pride,<br />
<span class="ind1">But mystically&mdash;in such guise</span><br />
That she might deem it nought beside<br />
<span class="ind1">The moment's converse; in her eyes</span><br />
I read, perhaps too carelessly&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">A mingled feeling with my own&mdash;</span><br />
The flush on her bright cheek, to me<br />
<span class="ind1">Seem'd to become a queenly throne</span><br />
Too well that I should let it be<br />
<span class="ind1">Light in the wilderness alone.</span><br />

I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,<br />
<span class="ind1">And donn'd a visionary crown&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="ind2">Yet it was not that Fantasy</span><br />
<span class="ind2">Had thrown her mantle over me&mdash;</span><br />
But that, among the rabble&mdash;men,<br />
<span class="ind1">Lion ambition is chained down&mdash;</span><br />
And crouches to a keeper's hand&mdash;<br />
Not so in deserts where the grand&mdash;<br />
The wild&mdash;the terrible conspire<br />
With their own breath to fan his fire.<br />
<br />
Look'round thee now on Samarcand!<br />
<span class="ind1">Is not she queen of Earth? her pride</span><br />
Above all cities? in her hand<br />
<span class="ind1">Their destinies? in all beside</span><br />
Of glory which the world hath known<br />
Stands she not nobly and alone?<br />
Falling&mdash;her veriest stepping-stone<br />
Shall form the pedestal of a throne&mdash;<br />
And who her sovereign? Timour&mdash;he<br />
<span class="ind1">Whom the astonished people saw</span><br />
Striding o'er empires haughtily<br />
<span class="ind1">A diadem'd outlaw!</span><br />
<br />
O, human love! thou spirit given,<br />
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!<br />
Which fall'st into the soul like rain<br />
Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain,<br />
And, failing in thy power to bless,<br />
But leav'st the heart a wilderness!<br />
Idea! which bindest life around<br />
With music of so strange a sound,<br />
And beauty of so wild a birth&mdash;<br />
Farewell! for I have won the Earth.<br />
<br />
When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see<br />
<span class="ind1">No cliff beyond him in the sky,</span><br />
His pinions were bent droopingly&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye.</span><br />
'Twas sunset: when the sun will part<br />
There comes a sullenness of heart<br />
To him who still would look upon<br />
The glory of the summer sun.<br />
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist,<br />
So often lovely, and will list<br />
To the sound of the coming darkness (known<br />
To those whose spirits hearken) as one<br />
Who, in a dream of night, <i>would</i> fly<br />
But <i>cannot</i>, from a danger nigh.<br />
<br />
What tho' the moon&mdash;the white moon<br />
Shed all the splendour of her noon,<br />
<i>Her</i> smile is chilly, and <i>her</i> beam,<br />
In that time of dreariness, will seem<br />
(So like you gather in your breath)<br />
A portrait taken after death.<br />
And boyhood is a summer sun<br />
Whose waning is the dreariest one&mdash;<br />
For all we live to know is known,<br />
And all we seek to keep hath flown&mdash;<br />
Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall<br />
With the noon-day beauty&mdash;which is all.<br />
I reach'd my home&mdash;my home no more&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">For all had flown who made it so.</span><br />
I pass'd from out its mossy door,<br />
<span class="ind1">And, tho' my tread was soft and low,</span><br />
A voice came from the threshold stone<br />
Of one whom I had earlier known&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">O, I defy thee, Hell, to show</span><br />
<span class="ind1">On beds of fire that burn below,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">A humbler heart&mdash;a deeper woe.</span><br />
<br />
Father, I firmly do believe&mdash;<br />
<span class="ind1">I <i>know</i>&mdash;for Death, who comes for me</span><br />
<span class="ind2">From regions of the blest afar,</span><br />
Where there is nothing to deceive,<br />
<span class="ind2">Hath left his iron gate ajar,</span><br />
<span class="ind1">And rays of truth you cannot see</span><br />
<span class="ind1">Are flashing thro' Eternity&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
I do believe that Eblis hath<br />
A snare in every human path&mdash;<br />
Else how, when in the holy grove<br />
I wandered of the idol, Love,<br />
Who daily scents his snowy wings<br />
With incense of burnt offerings<br />
From the most unpolluted things,<br />
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven<br />
Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven<br />
No mote may shun&mdash;no tiniest fly&mdash;<br />
The light'ning of his eagle eye&mdash;<br />
How was it that Ambition crept,<br />
<span class="ind1">Unseen, amid the revels there,</span><br />
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt<br />
<span class="ind1">In the tangles of Love's very hair?</span><br />

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
